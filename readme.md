My name is Rodrigo. I train myself to be creative all the time. And as creativity does not distinguish among
disciplines, I do it doing a lot of things. I study music and math. I have written for years. I bake my own
bread every week. Computers are part of my training. I write code to ask myself, to think, to design tools
which help me with what I do.
